# Frequency Analysis of semismic events

## Description
With use of Python's library ObsPy which is specifically made to work with seismic signals, I created a program that processes a locally stored data and performs a data analysis while outputting plots for further investigateion.

## Objectives
The main objective was to separate key seismic events based on predetermined specifications and provide them for further research.

## Technology
1. Python3
2. ObsPy
3. Numpy
4. Pandas

## How to use
This program is designed to read specific data, hence it is not meant to be used for generic data and needs to be modified.
